// here is series of questions and answers 

Q1/
What is JSX ?
JSX is syntex extension for javascript used in react. it lets you to write HTML-like code inside 
javascript. react official documentation refers to JSX as a "syntex extension for javascript language"

Q2/
Transpilation v/s Compilation
Transpilation: converting code from one version of a language to another 
(like JSX to JS, or ES6 to ES5)
Compilation: converting human-readable code into optimized, often lower-level code
(eg., bundling, minifying).

Q3/
What is Babel?
A javascript transpiler that transforms JS/JSX into a form that browsers can understand
(usually older javascript)

Q4/
What happens with JSX behind the scene?
Babel Transpiles JSX -> React.createElement:
Babel plugin (@babel/preset-react) converts JSX into pure JS, this is transpilation because 
JSX is just syntactic sugar for function calls not a newlanguage.

Babel Transpiles ES6 -> ES5
if you used modern JS fetures, Babel also converts that into older JavaScript
for compatibility.

Bundler Compilation (webpack,Vite,etc)
The transpiled files are bundled into a single/minified JS file. this step is
closer to Compilation since your project is being turned into something executable 
by the browser.
